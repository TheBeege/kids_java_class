# Class 02 - Variables and Methods

In programming, things can mostly be divided into two areas: knowing things and doing things. Knowing things, or storing information, is done using variables. Doing things is done using methods, also called functions.

## Variables
Again, variables are ways to store information, ways for programs to "know things." Another way to think about variables is like boxes. A variable is like a box - it stores something. These boxes also have a label. The label is the variable's name. These boxes also have sizes. The size is the type of data the variable stores - some data is bigger than others. Here's an example:
```java
int myVariable = 10;
```
`int` is the type of the data being stored, in this case, an integer. The box will be big enough to store an integer, and it can't store anything else.

`myVariable` is the name of the variable. This is like the label on the box.

`10` is the data that the variable is storing. This is what's been put inside the box.

You can also split this into two steps:
```java
int myVariable;
myVariable = 10;
```

The first line is called `declaration`. Declaration is telling Java that we need a box of a certain size and with a certain label - a data type and name.

The second line is called `initialization`. Initialization is setting the value of a variable for the first time.
